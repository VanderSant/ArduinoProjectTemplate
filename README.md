## ðŸš€ Ideia 
Hey everyone, sometimes i need to program some arduino or esp32, but I realy don't like the arduino IDE or the Arduino extension from vscode, because of that I'm trying to create a simple makefile to install esp32, check my codes, with all my libries, of course, and upload the bin file into the microcontroler.
To do that, i'm using the classical arduino program and the amazing arduino-cli, which is better in many ways.

## ðŸš§ Work in progress

I'll soon open a release and explain how to use in Windows and Ubuntu
